# What is Pilot?
Pilot is an AI-powered CLI agent with access to your filesystem via terminal. It takes your natural language prompt, generates the shell commands needed, and executes them automatically.

# Prerequisites:
You'll need two things before installing:

## Deno: 
[Deno](https://deno.com/) is a JavaScript runtime. Pilot uses it to compile and run.

#### For Mac And Linux :
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

#### For windows:
```powershell
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

## Gemini API Key:
Get your free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

# Installing Pilot
Lets not wait anymore and install pilot -

#### Cloning Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jayanth-14/pilot
cd pilot
```

#### Running the Installer
```bash
./install.sh
```

#### Setup API Key
Add your Gemini API key to the shell config file.
```bash
echo 'export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```
Replace "your-api-key" with your actual key from Google AI Studio.

# Usage
Now that the boring setup is done, let's move on to the fun part.

Basic Syntax:
```bash
pilot "your task in plain english"
```

Examples:
Here are few interactive examples to get started.
